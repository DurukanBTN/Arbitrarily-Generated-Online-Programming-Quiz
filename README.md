# Game Of Code

#### Description:
My project is a series of tests randomly generated and designed for programers and alike to test their skills and have some fun.

The main.html file contains the main page of my project with includes 3 links to the 3 different tests(hexadecimal, binary, language).

The binary.html file contains 2 links to either a binary to text or a text to binary test.

I had to have 2 different css files for my 2 binary related tests because the gifs I wanted to use in them had to match their background color which is different in both of them.

The hexadecimal.html file contains 2 links to either hexadecimal to color or color to hexadecimal tests.

Hexadecimal and binary tests are randomly generated each time meaning they can be played indefinitely.

I could not find a way to completely randomly generate the language test so I included a lot of examples to avoid the feeling of repetition as uch as possible.

I originally had the html as well in the language test but I had to remove it because the html syntax messed with my site because it is an html file as well.

I had to keep most of the css files seperate because I wanted to use diffrent gifs templates or colors for diffrent tests in order to not bore the user.

I chose to keep most of the elements, buttons, gifs and text in the middle to both simplify my coding experience and to simplify the user interface.

I had the idea of creating a series of mini games for my project but I didn't know what type of minigames I wanted to create that is why I chose to create mini games for programmers like me.

I realised that the code I use to transform text into binary was converting to binary without the initial zeroes. For example it wouldnt say 00110011 but instead 110011, I had to figure out an algorithm to make sure all the binary numbers were exactly 8 digits with the addition of the zeroes at the start in order to keep the consistency.

After I finished the initial coding I realized that the web page was pretty blank with black backgrounds and white fonts in all the pages that is when I decided the add different colors and some gifs to colorize my site.

Initially I only planned on making a binary to text and hexadecimal to color test but then I thought why not make the opposites as well because some users might find the alternative more fun or more intriguing. That is why I also created a text to binary and color to hexadecimal test aswell.
